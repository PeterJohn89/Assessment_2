			<h2 class="section-heading">Michael Hayes</h2>
			<p>Overall, I think the team functioned very well in compiling this report and our team website. Our team is graphically quite dispersed, with the team spread over 3 time zones for the majority of the duration of this assignment.</p>
			<p>I think dividing up the work (with 4 of us completing the tech write-ups and 1 doing both the interview and creating the website page template), worked well. (note: one initial team member was not involved, despite repeated attempts at contacting him over the report period). Also having everyone check over the report before the submission also worked.</p>
			<p>I think our decision making was great for the most part, however making a final decision on which project took longer than what it should off. Also we didn&rsquo;t have a time where all five members of the group where in the chat at the one time, something I think we will need to fix going forward with the next assignment (have a group chat in our MS Team or a voice chat on discord at the start, maybe one during and one towards the end).</p>
			<p>I was surprised about how effective we were in using the tools within MS Teams, as it was the first time for all the members to use that software and was really happy that everyone in the team was able to contribute fairly evenly.</p>
			<p>I learned that the team seem to be positive to having regular summaries of where we were at as a team and what was left to be completed. I was concerned that it might frustrate the team members, but the responses were all the opposite.</p>
			<p>Personally, I feel the Github commit trail on its own will not be a completely accurate representation of the group/individual efforts as a lot of work was placed directly into this report and done via our MS Team pages.</p>

			<div class="p-4"></div>
			<h2 class="section-heading">Kaleb Tomaszek</h2>

			<div>As a group, we quickly divided up the work and had a leader established to help make overall decisions. We were able to deduce who was the most confident creating and using Github repositories and therefore who would host our site. When assigned tasks, we all completed them without requiring assistance from each other which gave a lot more time for everyone to go over what they had written to perfect the information before it was collaborated. What could have been improved may be the overall organization of our team.</div>
			<div>&nbsp;</div>
			<div>We did not require team meetings to complete this task and relied upon everyone doing their part within the bounds of their own available time. We could have most definitely proposed to hold meetings so as to discuss all information, so that everyone understood all content of the report, rather than all understanding their own information and just putting the rest together on a report.</div>
			<div>I was surprised by how fast all the IT technology reports were completed, and I learned that in a group, many things can be researched at once and summarized in order for all members to gain the knowledge that one had located. Our Github log will not so accurately represent the work completed by each member for assessment 2 as all info for the assessment was submitted to Microsoft teams and not all members were required to access or manipulate the repository.</div>

			<div class="p-4"></div>
			<h2 class="section-heading">Andrew Waltos</h2>
			<div>The group worked very well together for this assignment. Everyone was eager and happy to work on different aspects. Michael took charge by showing great leadership and organization to set up canvas chat topics and Microsoft Teams channels. His direction made it clear and easy for all of us to get the required work done. His experience in web design made Peter a great choice for hosting the GitHub page and building a website frame. him.</div>
			<div>&nbsp;</div>
			<div>Dylan, Kaleb, Michael and I wrote reports on IT Tech and sent these through in MS Teams. As we all have differing schedules and availabilities, we could improve a little on communication by organizing a dedicated sit down where we all can have input on who does what perhaps via a scheduled Discord chat. I was quite surprised by how well MS Teams works - very easy and clear in regard to setting up channels and uploading files for other members to review. I learnt that team work is a very efficient way of getting work done by allocating tasks to suit people&rsquo;s strengths. The GitHub log will show accurately who changed and added content to the website but does not show behind the scenes work or organizing and individual efforts in report writing.</div>

			<div class="p-4"></div>
			<h2 class="section-heading">Dylan Moore</h2>
			<p>For a group that is connected through an application to share our ideas and thoughts, I believe we were effective and well organised. We had a reliable professional leader that helped keep the project on track and keep us up to date with our daily tasks. The work was divided up evenly to make it much easier for us to finish before the assignment due date. We were open to any ideas that would benefit the project and our team. For our communication, we didn&rsquo;t discuss over audio meetings but mainly just by writing on Microsoft teams and discord.</p>
			<p>Michael had created specific topic pages that were linked to our project, then we all contributed all our ideas and finished tasks into that folder in Microsoft Teams. All of the team members were very responsible and reliable, and it was easy to communicate with everyone and express new ideas. Learning from this experience only leaves a positive feedback for me, and for our next Assignment I believe it would be even more beneficial to have a group online meetings, video chats to facilitate our communication even more and have a set online meeting at a particular time. Overall I&rsquo;m very impressed with our team.</p>

			<h2 class="section-heading">Peter Goodwin</h2>
			<p>As a Group, we worked well together. Work was evenly spread, and our communication was excellent. Our Teammate Michael broke a complex task into manageable group chats, where we all talked about the roles we would like to work on. Michael was very clear to understand and easy going, which created a comfortable environment for our creativity to show. Andrew broke down the benefits of small computing devices, his report was very informative, I agree that soon every home will have a 3D&nbsp;printer and the benefits are astounding.</p>
			<p>Dylan wrote about Cybersecurity It was very interesting to know just how much we rely on Cybersecurity for internet banking. &nbsp; Michael, Kaleb, and Andrew all wrote on IT Technologies. I worked on a website on GitHub, created links for group profiles and hosted it on my GitHub repository. All reports were well written and researched. Some areas that could have been improved where perhaps an organised group chat, all at the same time. As I'm sure we all have other obligations, a group sit down once a week would have been more helpful in organising what everyone was up to date on, and what we need to work on. Overall my experience was pretty smooth with no big hiccups.</p>

			<div class="p-5"></div>
			<h2 class="section-heading">Project Extensionâ€™s overall feedback</h2>
			<p>Overall, based on the individual feedbacks (listed above) and chats during the assignment, the group feedback is very positive. This is surprising in one way, given the geographic spread of the team, it was our first time working together and no team member was familiar with MS Teams (our main communication method). This bodes well for the next assignment as each team member is now familiar with each other now (and each member&rsquo;s strengths and weaknesses and level of knowledge/areas of interest).</p>
			<p>Using MS Teams worked really well, as we were able to break down the assignment into various parts (and then into channels). Although the chat function was not utilised effectively until near the end of report completion. We also used Discord to chat (as an additional discussion board). Universally the team felt we could have better used Discord and organised more group voice chats. This will the major aim to improve in communication in the next assignment to organise more group chats (probably on Discord) using a combination of voice and text that Discord provides. We will need to organise a chat near the start and possibly regular chats during the assignment, along with the MS Teams posts. By the end of the assignment everyone was also able to access the group report doc file for checking and contribution.</p>
			<p>Everyone was able to contribute during the assignment, with the division of labour fairly evenly spread. Everyone was able to provide their profile paragraphs (which they individual uploaded to the group page). Individually each member also completed their industry data sections and feedbacks. The remaining of the work was split between the 5 members with:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Peter completing the IT Interview as well as designing/building the website and pages,</li>
				<li>Andrew completed the IT Technology &ldquo;write up&rdquo; on small computer devices,</li>
				<li>Dylan completed the IT Technology &ldquo;write up&rdquo; on cybersecurity,</li>
				<li>Kaleb completed the IT Technology &ldquo;write up&rdquo; on natural language processors,</li>
				<li>And Michael completed the IT Technology &ldquo;write up&rdquo; on Machine Learning and compiled the report,</li>
				<li>With everybody preforming final reviews of the document and website.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Overall the team believed the group dynamics worked well and everyone contributed. The team felt Michael took on a leadership role with his organisation of the various channels and with regular updates of the team progress, which seems to have been appreciated by the team members.</p>
			<p>Ultimately the team felt that through-out this assignment, the team worked well together and everyone contributed (other than our MIA member Scott), because of this we were able to achieve this report and related website to a high standard. The team looks forward to facing the next assignment together</p>
