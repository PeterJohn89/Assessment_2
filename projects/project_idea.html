			<h3>Mindgames</h3>
			<p>Together the team here at Project Extension having been planning out our first major collaboration project:-</p>

			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Mindgames is an interactive gaming website and application, which hosts are growing library of educational games and puzzles. Our target users are primary school students, who will have the ability to play a number of interactive games via our website or via our Android and iPhone apps.</p>
			<p>Our goal is to help improve young student with their learning skills, complementing what they are taught in school. Other than having entertainment value, problem-solving games have been shown to improve users cognitive, social, mathematical and problem-solving skills.</p>
			<p>The gamification of the system will push students to improve their skills as more levels and different types of games become available the more the students use the site/app. Additionally the puzzles will update each year as the student progresses with school to reflect the studies the student will undertake in that school year.</p>
			<p>All information stored about the student is de-identified with the user only needing to enter the student&rsquo;s year of birth, school year and state and create a username tied to a parent&rsquo;s email address. An option will be available for the parent to receive a monthly report of their child&rsquo;s activity, which may include the following metrics:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Hours the student has used the program</li>
				<li>The student&rsquo;s progress</li>
				<li>Where our algorithms have determined the student is above or below our average user for that student&rsquo;s age, year level and state,</li>
				<li> Possible tips to discuss with the student teachers on what areas the student might need support with and tips to help parents at home with these areas.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>In the future we hope to align with primary schools to better reflect their teaching goals for students and customise the release of games to their class schedule. We may also provide metrics to the school in the future with parent&rsquo;s consent.</p>
			<p>Eventually we hope to have a revenue stream from the Education Departments and schools, however initially we will need revenue from a combination of advertising and pay for use models. We will have a free version of the app/website access, with basic games, advertising and no metrics available. We will also have either a subscription model or a paid app model to access the full suite of games and metrics.</p>
			<p>Mindgames will also offer more advanced options for a premium. These advanced options will offer parents the option to tailor their child&rsquo;s games to focus on areas they feel their child need help with, with more powerful suggestions of where the student should focus provided by our machine learning algorithms. Parent&rsquo;s will also be able to setup mini goals for their kids (based on completion of games or time spent). These goals may even involve unlocking other apps on the phone/tablet (such as Youtube kids or ABC kids iView) for a certain amount of time as a reward.</p>
			<p>The games themselves will be initially provided in-house with options of other providers to provide their own games, hosted by Mindgames. Mindgames will pay the other providers a royalty but the hosting will be reviewed twice annually and unproductive or unpopular games may be dropped.</p>
