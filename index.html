              <p class="lead"><strong>Based at RMIT University in Melbourne Australia, Project Extension is a part of the next wave of Information Technology start-ups cropping up all over the world.</strong> No longer is Silicon Valley, or even the USA the only home of IT innovation. With our constantly connected world, innovation and hard work can spread across the globe.</p>

              <p class="lead">Our team has members from both coasts of Australia, from as far apart as Queensland’s Gold Coast to Western Austalias capital Perth, from Sydney to Melbourne and even from in-between. The five of us came together in our first year RMIT, in fact this is how we came up with our name. We were all placed in “Assignment Group 6”. From that we noticed that 6 is 110 in binary and if we took the letters from 1(one), 10(ten) and 6(six), we could create Extension. The idea of pushing further and extending ourselves and the IT industry is what drives us forward through our studies today.</p>

              <p>As you can tell from the results our team is heavily focused on developing/programming. With the full range of development types from web applications, to game development to a more general software development. Our career paths are very similar in a lot of ways and our ideal jobs highlight that we have not taken on this challenge of higher education lightly but as the next step on the long road to gain our ideal jobs.</p>
              <p>Our test results also highlight one of our strengths in the group; our variety of skills and styles we bring to the table. There is some overlap in our Myers-Briggs type testing, but we still have at least one member with each of the possible outcomes. For example, while the majority of the team is classed as having introverted tendencies, we still have an extravert member. This is also reflected in our learning styles, as a team we all learn in different ways (Audio(A) based, Visually (V) based or Tactilely (T) based).</p>
              <p>As a team we work to overcome these differences by having options to communicate via message-boards or via voice using websites like discord. This teamwork is one of the major advantages we offer to all our clients. Finally, as further proof of our ability to work with the differences in strengths of our team, look no further than the 3rd test result. This test was an open option for our team to pick a test and share the results. As you can see the tests picked by each individual member highlights something about that member and where they see their strengths and weaknesses. Some were logic based (e.g. numerical reasoning), some were creativity based and some were more personality based in nature (e.g. Big five personality test).</p>
