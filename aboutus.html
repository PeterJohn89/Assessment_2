Dylan used to play video games at a young age and still does on a occasion play sport games when he has time. His favourite game at the moment is FIFA 19 which is created by EA Games. 
Over the years Dylan has developed knowledge in IT gained by experience with fixing other people's computers and even his own laptop. His wife had been telling him he should get a bachelor in IT, and he decided this year he would pursue this. His other hobbies include fishing and creating lyrics to write Christian rap songs.
